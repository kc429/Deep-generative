### About

Deep generative models (DGMs) have become an important branch of deep learning which now includes methods such as variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, normalizing flows, energy based models and autoregressive models. Many of these methods have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in the generation of synthetic data such as text, speech, images, music, molecules, etc. However, besides just generating synthetic data, DGMs are of relevance in practical downstream applications. A few examples are

- Imputation and acquisition of missing data [12,1]
- Anomaly detection [2]
- Data denoising [11]
- Compressed sensing [10]
- Image compression [3,4]
- Image super-resolution [5]
- Molecule optimization [6]
- Interpretation of machine learning methods [7]
- One-shot generation of low-energy molecular structures [8]
- Computation of free-energy differences between molecular states [8]
- Estimating intervention effects from observational data [9]

Despite such important application areas, advances in DGMs are typically quantified using general metrics such as test log-likelihood, conditional data reconstruction error, inception scores or visual inspection of the generated samples. These metrics are useful for justifying gains with
respect to baselines when no specific application is in mind, but they may also be poor indicators of performance in practical downstream applications.

At present, there is a gap between researchers working on new DGM-based methods and researchers applying such methods to practical problems (like the ones mentioned above). We aim to fill in this gap by bringing the two aforementioned communities together. We will connect basic researchers working in the area of DGMs with relevant application areas where their
methods could have significant practical impact. We will also connect practitioners with the most recent methodological advances in deep generative modeling.

In a highly interactive format, we will outline the current frontiers of practical applications and methodological contributions in DGMs. We aim to use this workshop as an opportunity to establish common language across diverse communities, to actively discuss new research problems, and to collect relevant benchmark tasks by which novel data modeling methods can
be benchmarked. The program is a collection of invited talks, alongside contributed posters. A panel discussion will provide different perspectives and experiences of influential researchers and also engage in open participant conversation. An expected outcome of this workshop is the
interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and initiation of collaborations.
